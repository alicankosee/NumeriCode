      "Interpolation is a method of estimating values between two known data points. It is commonly used to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.",
      "Linear interpolation connects two adjacent data points with a straight line and estimates intermediate values along that line. It is simple and efficient but may not capture curvature in the data.",
      "Cubic spline interpolation uses piecewise cubic polynomials to produce a smooth curve that passes through all given data points. It maintains continuity of the function and its first and second derivatives.",
      "Spline interpolation is especially useful when a smooth curve is needed, such as in computer graphics, animation, and data fitting in scientific computation.",
      "Boundary conditions such as natural spline (second derivative = 0 at endpoints) or clamped spline (specified first derivative at endpoints) influence the shape of the cubic spline.",
      "Compared to polynomial interpolation, which can suffer from oscillations (Runge\u2019s phenomenon), spline interpolation is more stable and accurate for large datasets."
