      "Optimization is the process of finding the best solution or maximum/minimum value of a function within a given set of constraints.",
      "Optimization problems are common in engineering, economics, machine learning, and many scientific fields.",
      "There are two main types: unconstrained optimization (no restrictions on variables) and constrained optimization (variables must satisfy certain conditions).",
      "Common methods for unconstrained optimization include gradient descent, Newton's method, and the golden section search.",
      "Constrained optimization often uses methods like Lagrange multipliers, simplex method, or penalty functions.",
      "Local optimization finds the best solution in a small region, while global optimization seeks the absolute best over the entire domain.",
      "Convex optimization problems have a single global minimum, making them easier to solve.",
      "Nonlinear and non-convex problems may have multiple local minima and require more advanced techniques."
