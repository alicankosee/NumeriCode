      "LU decomposition is a matrix factorization technique that expresses a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U).",
      "It is widely used to solve linear systems, invert matrices, and compute determinants efficiently.",
      "The process involves decomposing a square matrix A into A = LU, where L has ones on the diagonal and U is upper triangular.",
      "LU decomposition simplifies solving Ax = b by first solving Ly = b (forward substitution) and then Ux = y (back substitution).",
      "Not all matrices have an LU decomposition without row exchanges; partial pivoting may be required.",
      "LU decomposition is more efficient than Gaussian elimination when solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix.",
